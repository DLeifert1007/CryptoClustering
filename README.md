# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, cryptocurrencies were classified according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Utilizing K-means algorythems and principal component analysis specific price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and one year. 

After preparing the data, I used the elbow method to find the best value for k and then clustered the data based on this. 

Next, the Principal Component Analysis was utilized to reduce the features to three principal components. With this data I used the elbow method to find the best value for k.

Using K-Means with the PCA data, the cryptocurrencies were clustered for best value. 

Lastly, I determined the weights of each feature or column in order to find the strongest positive and strongest negative influences on each component.
